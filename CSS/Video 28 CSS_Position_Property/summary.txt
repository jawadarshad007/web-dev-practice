CSS position - to manipulate the location of an element

1- position: static;  //(by default property , no effect of top, bottom, left, right, z-index) 
2- position: relative;  //(shift the position according to its actual position)
3- position: absolute : apne nearest ancestor positioned parent k relative change hoga***
4- position: fixed; // same as absolute, except the element is positioned relative to browser window
                                  no effect of scroll

5- position: sticky; // element is positioned based on scroll position, until the scroll location of the viewport reaches a specified threshold. (when scroll in sticky container it behaves like static)
