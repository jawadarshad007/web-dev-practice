Key points in this lecture:
1. fr means fraction - helps in distributing grids evenly.
2. repeat saves time in setting fractions.
3. minmax functions helps in adjusting cell width and height with minimum and maximum set values.
4. align-self, justify-self, justify-items, align-items works within grid cells.
5. "justify-content", "align-content" works within the entire grid container, "place-content" does both of their jobs in one go.
6. "justify" arranges items around the main axis and "align" arranges the items around cross axis.
7. Use "gap" instead of "padding" in grid or flex.
8. Lastly always try to use "start" and "end" rather than "flex-start" or "flex-end".
