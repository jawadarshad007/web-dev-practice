summery:
CSS Overflow: content that is too large for an elements box, 
                          CSS overflow property can be used to modify how overflow is handled.

Property:

1) overflow: visible;   // (default property) overflow content is visible.

2) overflow: scroll;   // Scrollbar always visible even content not overflow the box.

3) overflow: auto;   // If content overflow the box, scrollbar automatically visible or created.

4) overflow: clip;  // No scroll bar, even content overflow. overflow content not visible (same as overflow:scroll property).

//** doubt - what is the programmatically scroll?

5)  white-space: nowrap; //content only in single line (in x axis only), so we can scroll horizontally only. 

6) text-overflow: ellipsis;  //content only in single line (in x axis only), overflow text will not visible, overflow text denoted by  ... (three dots) . 

7) overflow-x: hidden
overflow-y: scroll   //  scrollbar in x and y direction as per requirement.

=>Shorten for overflow x and overflow y

overflow: hidden scroll

**doubt- in my case (overflow-x: scroll; overflow-y: hidden;) not working
